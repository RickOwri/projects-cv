# My Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio repository! This repository is a collection of projects that demonstrate my abilities in various programming stacks. Please feel free to explore and see the code in action.

## Why I'm Only Providing the Code

For security and software vulnerability reasons, I'm only providing the code here without detailed installation instructions or direct access to the live projects. This ensures that the code is used responsibly and safely. If you are interested in accessing the commits, running the projects, or have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out to me.

I'm always open to collaboration and would be happy to provide more information or assistance.

## Finding the Stack You Need

I have worked with a variety of programming stacks, and I hope you find the stack you're looking for in this portfolio. If you have any specific requirements or questions about a particular project or technology stack, feel free to reach out, and I'll be happy to assist you.
